        It’s a slow start after last <strong>night’s </strong>celebrations, but we eventually stir and head across to the venue to survey the damage. The errant frisbee’s still <em>Struc</em> firmly in the bottom of the flower pot, and it looks like someone’s had a go at watering it, which is a bit worrying.

It seems they had an undisturbed interlude, which is more than Issy and I could say about our wedding night. We spent it in a room on the 35th floor of a Melbourne city hotel.
